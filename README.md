TechnicSolderHelper
===================

Technic Solder Helper is a tool that helps you pack modpack files in the correct format.

Right now only Technic is supported, but support for FTB and AT launcher are in the works. 

A compiled version of this can be found at: http://zlepper.dk/solderhelper/publish.htm

For linux just download the installer.sh file and run it. It will install the program in your home directory, though it can be changed in the script. 

For mac I have no idea if this will work or not. I don't have a mac, so I can't test.
